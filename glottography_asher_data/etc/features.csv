Linguistically they are like German vs Swedish. Sudanese (and Chadian) Arabic is spoken by townspeople as well as by herders who are or were semi-nomadic until recently. With the latter the tribal affiliation is more important than wider linguistic or national identity so they name themselves by the tribe which is usually something like (sons of) Ibrahim, Muhammed, Ali and what not. Names 1-22 of the Atlas screenshot are such names of tribes in the Sudan-Chad area.  I had not seen Hassaniya as the name of such a Sudan-Chad Arabic tribe but it is perfectly possible that there is one. So the short story is that Hassaniya n 10 in the Atlas should be mapped to Sudanese Arabic [apd] rather than [mey]."""
